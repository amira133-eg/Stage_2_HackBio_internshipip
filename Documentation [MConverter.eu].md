**Overview**

This Shiny application is a tool to perform standard laboratory
calculations related to reagent production. The application has four
modules:

1.  Serial Dilution Calculator

2.  Stock Solution Dilution Calculator

3.  Molarity Calculator

4.  Solution Density Calculator

Each module allows users to enter parameters and receive fast responses
for critical laboratory computations.

**Purpose**

The goal of the application is to simplify laboratory calculations and
ensure accuracy while preparing solutions and reagents. This is
especially useful for biochemists, chemists, and students working in
laboratories that require exact measurements.

**Features**

- **Serial Dilution Calculator**: Calculates the volume of stock
  solution needed to dilute a solution to a desired concentration.

- **Stock Solution Dilution Calculator**: Calculates how much stock
  solution and solvent to add to achieve a specific final concentration
  and volume.

- **Molarity Calculator**: Computes the molarity of a solution given the
  solute mass, molar mass, and solution volume.

- **Solution Density Calculator**: Calculates the density of a solution
  given its mass and volume.

**How to Use**

1.  **Serial Dilution:**

    - Enter the initial concentration, desired concentration, dilution
      factor, and total volume.

    - Click \"Calculate Serial Dilution\" to get the volume to transfer
      at each step.

2.  **Stock Solution Dilution:**

    - Enter the stock concentration, desired concentration, and total
      final volume.

    - Click \"Calculate Stock Dilution\" to get the volume of stock
      solution and solvent needed.

3.  **Molarity:**

    - Enter the mass of solute, molar mass, and solution volume.

    - Click \"Calculate Molarity\" to get the molarity in mol/L.

4.  **Solution Density:**

    - Enter the mass and volume of the solution.

    - Click \"Calculate Density\" to get the density in g/mL.

**Future Improvements:**

- Additional Calculators: You might add more scientific calculators to
  the application (for example, pH calculator and buffer preparation).

- Input Validation: Use input validation to prevent invalid data entry.

- Use packages like ggplot2 to depict dilution curves and other
  interactive components.

**Conclusion:  
**This Shiny program streamlines typical laboratory calculations. The
modular architecture allows for easy extension of additional
functionalities as needed.
