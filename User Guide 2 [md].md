**Serial Dilution** is a process where a solution is diluted in a
stepwise manner. Each $
dilution\ step\ involves\ mixing\ a\ portion\ of\ the\ current\ solution\ with\ a\ diluent,\ which$progressively
reduces the concentration of the solute.

**Inputs:**

- **Stock Solution Name**: Enter the name of the stock solution.

- **Diluent Name**: Enter the name of the diluent used.

- **Initial Concentration (C₀)**: The starting concentration of the
  stock solution (e.g., 10 M).

- **Desired Final Concentration (Cₓ)**: The concentration you want to
  achieve after dilution (e.g., 1 M).

- **Dilution Factor (DF)**: The factor by which the solution is diluted
  in each step (e.g., 10).

- **Total Volume (Vₓ)**: The total volume of the solution after each
  dilution step (e.g., 100 mL).

- **Number of Dilutions**: The number of dilution steps to be performed.

- **Number of Replicates (optional)**: Number of replicate dilutions if
  needed.

**How to calculate the volumes?**

For each dilution step, the following calculations are performed:

- **Volume of Stock Solution (Vs)**: $\frac{C0 \times Vx}{Cx \times DF}$

- **Volume of Diluent**: Vd=Vx-Vs

- The initial concentration C₀ is updated by dividing it by the dilution
  factor for each step.

- The results will be displayed in a table, showing the volume of stock
  solution and diluent needed at each step.

**Inputs**

- **Stock Concentration (Cs)**: The concentration of the stock solution
  (e.g., 100 M).

- **Desired Final Concentration (Cₓ)**: The concentration you want to
  achieve (e.g., 10 M).

- **Final Total Volume (Vₓ)**: The total volume of the final solution
  (e.g., 100 mL).

**Concept of volume calculation:**

- **Volume of Stock Solution (Vs)** : $\frac{Cx \times Vx}{Cs}$

The dilution equation is derived from the concept that the amount of
solute remains constant before and after dilution.

- Initially, the moles of solute is: Moles=Cs×Vs, ​

- After dilution :Moles=Cx×Vx

- Since moles are conserved: Cs×Vs=Cx×Vx

<!-- -->

- **Volume of Solvent**: *Vsolvent​=Vx​−Vs​​*

**Molarity Calculator**

height="4.300372922134733in"}

**Inputs**

- **Mass of Solute (g)**: The mass of the solute used (e.g., 10 g).

- **Molar Mass of Solute (g/mol)**: The molar mass of the solute (e.g.,
  180 g/mol).

- **Volume of Solution (L)**: The volume of the solution (e.g., 1 L).

**Concept of molarity calculation:**

Moles of solute can be calculated by dividing the mass by the molar
mass:

Moles =$\ \frac{mass}{molar\ mass}$

**Molarity** is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution,

M = $\frac{moles}{volume}$ , Substituting the moles formula:

**M
=**$\mathbf{\ }\frac{\mathbf{mass}}{\mathbf{Cmolar\ mass \times volumes}}$

**Inputs**

- **Mass of Solution (g)**: The mass of the solution (e.g., 100 g).

- **Volume of Solution (mL)**: The volume of the solution (e.g., 100
  mL).

**Concept of density calculation:**

**Density** is defined as the mass of a substance divided by its volume.

$$\left( \mathbf{\rho} \right)\mathbf{:}\frac{\mathbf{mass(solution)}}{\mathbf{volume(solution)}}$$
