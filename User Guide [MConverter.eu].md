**User Guide: Laboratory Calculation Dashboard**

# **Introduction**

This Shiny application is intended to assist users with daily laboratory
calculations related to reagent preparation. It has modules for:

1.  # Serial Dilution Calculator

2. # Stock Solution Dilution Calculator

3. #  Molarity Calculator

4. # Solution Density Calculator

Each module is accompanied by inputs that allow users to specify
parameters, and the results are displayed interactively.

# **Overview of the Interface**

- **Title Panel**: Displays the title \"Laboratory Calculation
  Dashboard\".

- **Sidebar Panel**: Contains all input fields and action buttons for
  the different calculations.

- **Main Panel**: Displays the results of the calculations.

# **Using Each Calculator**

# 1.  **Serial Dilution Calculator**

> Help you calculate the volume of stock solution to transfer at each
> step of a serial dilution.
>
> **Inputs**:

- **Initial Concentration (C₀)**: The concentration of your starting
  stock solution.

- **Desired Final Concentration (Cₓ)**: The concentration you want to
  achieve after the dilution.

- **Dilution Factor (DF)**: The factor by which the solution is diluted
  at each step.

- **Total Volume (Vₓ, mL)**: The final volume of the diluted solution.

> **Actions**:
>
> Click the **Calculate Serial Dilution** button to calculate the volume
> of stock solution to transfer.
>
> **Output**:
>
> The result will show the **volume to transfer at each step**-in
> milliliter (mL).

# 2.  **Stock Solution Dilution Calculator**

> This calculator determines the amount of stock solution and solvent
> needed to reach a desired final concentration.
>
> **Inputs**:

- **Stock Concentration (Cₛ)**: The concentration of your stock
  solution.

- **Desired Final Concentration (Cₓ)**: The target concentration for
  your solution.

- **Final Total Volume (Vₓ, mL)**: The total volume you need.

>  **Actions**:
>
> Click the **Calculate Stock Dilution** button to calculate the
> required volumes.
>
>  **Output**:
>
> The result will display the **volume of stock solution to add** and
> the **volume of solvent** to complete the total volume.

 # 3. **Molarity Calculator**

> This module calculates the molarity of a solution based on the
> solute\'s mass, molar mass, and the solution volume.
>
> **Inputs**:

- **Mass of Solute (g)**: The mass of the solute you are using.

- **Molar Mass of Solute (g/mol)**: The molar mass of the solute (you
  can find this in a chemical database or product label).

- **Volume of Solution (L)**: The total volume of the solution in liters
  (L).

> **Actions**:
>
> Click the **Calculate Molarity** button to compute the molarity.
>
> **Output**:
>
> The result will show the **molarity** of the solution in mol/L.

# 4.  **Solution Density Calculator**

> This module calculates the density of a solution based on its mass and
> volume.
>
> **Inputs**:

- **Mass of Solution (g)**: The total mass of the solution.

- **Volume of Solution (mL)**: The total volume of the solution.

> **Actions**:
>
> Click the **Calculate Density** button to calculate the density.
>
> **Output**:
>
> The result will display the **density** in grams per milliliter
> (g/mL).
